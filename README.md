SELECT
     id_host,</br>
     avg(DATEDIFF(ds_checkin, ts_booking_at)) AS avg_days_between_booking_and_checkin</br>
FROM airbnb_contacts</br>
GROUP BY 
     id_host</br>
HAVING 
     avg(DATEDIFF(ds_checkin, ts_booking_at)) >= 0</br>
ORDER BY 
     avg_days_between_booking_and_checkin DESC</br>

**Solution breakdown**
1. __SELECT__: We select host_id as asked, Since both columns have different formats, we will use the 'DATEDIFF' clause and then the column name 1 and column name 2
2. __GROUP BY__: for each host we use host_id
3. __HAVING__: Once used GROUP BY we can't use WHERE, we can only use HAVING since it is used for GROUP and not each record
4. __ORDER BY__: To order the avg_days in descending order
